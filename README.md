We develop smart textiles over several levels.

# Level 1: Textile Light Circuit

In this level, we create a LED light circuit for application on textiles. This could be used for:

1. Adapt a fluo safety jacket to make it more save
2. Pimp a cap for the sports team you supporter for 
3. Make a halloween costume

What makes this circuit different from a normal light circuit is that we use textile elements or electronical components adapted for use on textiles.
