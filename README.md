We develop projects in smart textiles in different levels of difficulty.

# Level 1: Textile Light Circuit

In this level, we create a LED light circuit for application on textiles. This could be used for:

1. Adapt a fluo safety jacket to make it more save
2. Pimp a cap of your favourite sports team 
3. Make a halloween costume

What makes this circuit different from a normal light circuit is that we use textile elements or electronical components adapted for use on textiles.

See Details on the [Construction page!](level01/construction.md)

# Level 2: Textile Push Button

In this level, we show how a textile push button can be created. This allows you to react on a push: make a sound, light up 
a floor mat, ... . You could create with it:

1. Interactive textile for a children toy
2. A doormat that shines if you stand on it 
3. Part of a costume

We use textile elements or electronical components adapted for use on textiles to realise the button.

# Level 3: Textile pressure sensor

In this level we add computing power! We detect a pressure level with a textile sensor, and react to this pressure with some actions. This can be used as a fun input method for toys, detect steps, ...
