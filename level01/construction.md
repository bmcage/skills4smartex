We develop smart textiles over several levels.

# Level 1: Textile Light Circuit

## Introduction

In this level, we create a LED light circuit for application on textiles. This could be used for:

1. Adapt a fluo safety jacket to make it more save
2. Pimp a cap for the sports team you supporter for 
3. Make a halloween costume

What makes this circuit different from a normal light circuit is that we use textile elements or electronical components 
adapted for use on textiles.

## BOM (Bill of Materials)

1. Base textile: a T-shirt, a baseball cap, a fabric. Select the textile you want to add lights to!
    1. Fruit of the Loom t-shirts can be bought for less than 2 Eur/T-shirt. Google it!
    2. Baseball caps can be bought for 1 to 2 Eur. 
    3. Cotton bags can be bought for less than 2 Eur, eg [De Banier](https://www.debanier.be/katoenen-zak-38-x-42-cm-met-lang-schouderlint-ecru.html)
2. Design: Your final product will be nicer if there is a design on your base textile. You can use other fabrics to make
a design, or use transfer vinyl paper, or transfer paper, or embroidery. Make sure in your design it is clear where the LED-Lights
go. A single small coincell battery can power maximally 3 LED1
3. Conductive thread. You need a high conductive (low resistance) conductive yarn. Some options:
    1. Stainless steel. The cheapest option. Many resellers of [adafruit Stainless Thin Conductive Thread](https://www.adafruit.com/product/640), for example [Mouser](https://www.mouser.be/ProductDetail/Adafruit/603?qs=sGAEpiMZZMu%252BmKbOcEVhFQfi8wYXkauJFoZL2xpCq%252BVRONBlSbRF3w%3D%3D)
    2. Silver plated yarn. The highest conductivity. Madeira has a range for embroidery that can be bought from every Madeira reseller: [HC 12 150m SMALL CONE](https://shop.madeira.co.uk/hc-12-150m-sample-(high-conductive)_hc12-smp-xxx-xxx.htm)
4. LED lights. You can use standard ones (cheapest) or specially designed (brighter)
    1. Sewable LED lights with integrated resistor, eg from [Kitronik](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/2746-electro-fashion-sewable-5mm-led-holder-pack-of-10.html)
    2. Standard 3V LED packs, eg from [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/APTWONZ-2-poligen-Diffuse-Leuchtdioden-Elektronikkomponenten/dp/B06X3VT6TD)
5. Battery holder for coincell battery. We use a 3.3V coincell. You can buy a normal coincell holder, one specifically designed for textile, or 3D print one.
    1. Sewable battery holder with switch, eg from [Kitronik](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/2711-electro-fashion-switched-coin-cell-holder.html)
    2. Sewable battery holder without switch, eg from [Kitronik](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/2701-sewable-coin-cell-holder.html)
    3. 3V battery holder standard with holes that allow sewing, eg [BA2032SM](https://www.enrgtech.co.uk/buy/product/ET14129119/BA2032SM)
    4. 3D print 3V battery holder, eg [this design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:265116) or [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:250503)
6. A Switch. You need to be able to switch off the lights, so they are only on when needed. It is possible to buy a coincell
holder with a switch, or make a switch from conductive parts.
    1. Sewable battery holder with switch, eg from [Kitronik](https://www.kitronik.co.uk/2711-electro-fashion-switched-coin-cell-holder.html)
    2. Conductive snap buttons (poppers). Verify they are conductive, many snap buttons are sold with a coating which is **not** conductive. Buy for example on [aliexpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/32803692281.html?spm=a2g0z.search0104.3.9.651b8b77wqucHb&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_10_10065_10068_319_317_10696_10084_)
    3. Conductive Silver plated velcro. Expensive but very good switch in textile projects, buy for example with [Mission Control Lab](https://missioncontrollab.com/products/space-hook)

## Demonstrator 01 Construction

We will make a demonstrator showing how to make a LED light circuit on fabric in a way that the fabric is still maximally flexible.
