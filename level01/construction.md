We develop smart textiles over several levels.

# Level 1: Textile Light Circuit

## Introduction

In this level, we create a LED light circuit for application on textiles. This could be used for:

1. Adapt a fluo safety jacket to make it more save
2. Pimp a cap for the sports team you supporter for 
3. Make a halloween costume

What makes this circuit different from a normal light circuit is that we use textile elements or electronical components 
adapted for use on textiles.

## BOM (Bill of Materials)

1. Base textile: a T-shirt, a baseball cap, a fabric. Select the textile you want to add lights to!
2. Design: Your final product will be nicer if there is a design on your base textile. You can use other fabrics to make
a design, or use transfer vinyl paper, or transfer paper, or embroidery. Make sure in your design it is clear where the LED-Lights
go. A single small coincell battery can power maximally 3 LED1
3. Conductive thread. You need a high conductive (low resistance) conductive yarn. Some options:
    1. Stainless steel. The cheapest option. 
    2. Silver plated yarn. The highest conductivity.
4. LED lights. You can use standard ones (cheapest) or specially designed (brighter)
5. Battery holder for coincell battery. We use a 3.3V coincell. You can buy a normal coincell holder, one specifically designed for textile, or 3D print one.
6. A Switch. You need to be able to switch off the lights, so they are only on when needed. It is possible to buy a coincell
holder with a switch, or make a switch from conductive parts.
